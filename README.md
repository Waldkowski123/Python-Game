# Python-Game


During the Christmas holidays, I had the idea of making a python game. The game was made using the PyGame library.
I made a game about a classmate because I wanted to create something for my class. They liked my game very much and it gave me a lot of motivation and happiness.
The game is in Polish because I wanted all my classmates to have no problem understanding it.
